    "# Financial Portfolio Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a Financial Portfolio Manager that assists users in managing their investments using **Group Chat** for agent collaboration and **StateFlow** for dynamic workflow management based on user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This agentic system will begin with a **User Proxy Agent** which will initiate a chat with the **Group Chat Manager**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Group Chat Manager will then call the **Portfolio Analysis Agent**, which will take user inputs and summarize their investment portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the insights from the Portfolio Analysis Agent, the workflow will be dynamically managed using StateFlow to either the **Growth Investment Agent** or the **Value Investment Agent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, these agents will share their outputs with the **Investment Advisor Agent**, which will generate a personalized financial report for the user.\n",

      "To maximize your portfolio growth, here are some high-growth investment options to consider, given your current salary and portfolio structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Increase Stock Allocation**\n",
      "   - **Technology Sector**: Consider investing in high-growth tech stocks or ETFs that focus on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. Companies like NVIDIA, Amazon, and Microsoft have shown strong growth potential.\n",
      "   - **Healthcare and Biotech**: Look into biotech firms and healthcare technology companies that are innovating in areas like gene therapy and telemedicine. Stocks like Moderna or Teladoc could be worth exploring.\n",
      "   - **Renewable Energy**: With the global shift towards sustainability, consider investing in renewable energy companies or ETFs focused on solar, wind, and electric vehicles (e.g., Tesla, NextEra Energy).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Diversify with Growth ETFs**\n",
      "   - **Growth ETFs**: Exchange-traded funds that focus on growth stocks can provide diversification while still targeting high-growth sectors. Look for ETFs like the Invesco QQQ Trust (which tracks the Nasdaq-100) or the Vanguard Growth ETF.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Consider International Markets**\n",
      "   - **Emerging Markets**: Investing in emerging markets can provide exposure to high-growth economies. Look for mutual funds or ETFs that focus on countries like India, Brazil, or Southeast Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**\n",
      "   - **Growth REITs**: Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to REITs that focus on growth sectors such as data centers, logistics, and healthcare facilities. These can provide both capital appreciation and income.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Cryptocurrencies**\n",
      "   - **Digital Assets**: If you have a higher risk tolerance, consider allocating a small percentage of your portfolio to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which have shown significant growth potential. However, be cautious due to their volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Venture Capital or Private Equity**\n",
      "   - **Alternative Investments**: If you have access, consider investing in venture capital funds or private equity, which can offer high returns by investing in startups or private companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **Dollar-Cost Averaging**\n",
      "   - **Consistent Investment**: To mitigate market volatility, consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy where you invest a fixed amount regularly into your chosen growth investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Portfolio Adjustment Recommendation:\n",
      "- **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Consider reallocating a portion of your bonds (e.g., reducing from $30,000 to $20,000) to increase your stock investments (e.g., increasing from $50,000 to $60,000). This can enhance your growth potential while still maintaining some bond stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "By focusing on high-growth sectors and diversifying your investments, you can maximize your portfolio's growth potential. Always consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon before making significant changes to your portfolio. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your financial goals.\n",
