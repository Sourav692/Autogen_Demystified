    "# Financial Portfolio Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a Financial Portfolio Manager that assists users in managing their investments using **Group Chat** for agent collaboration and **StateFlow** for dynamic workflow management based on user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This agentic system will begin with a **User Proxy Agent** which will initiate a chat with the **Group Chat Manager**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Group Chat Manager will then call the **Portfolio Analysis Agent**, which will take user inputs and summarize their investment portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the insights from the Portfolio Analysis Agent, the workflow will be dynamically managed using StateFlow to either the **Growth Investment Agent** or the **Value Investment Agent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, these agents will share their outputs with the **Investment Advisor Agent**, which will generate a personalized financial report for the user.\n",

      "Based on your current financial situation and retirement timeline, here are some recommendations for stable, low-risk investments that align with your preference for predictable returns:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Increase Allocation to Bonds:**\n",
      "   - **Treasury Bonds or Municipal Bonds:** These are considered very safe investments. Treasury bonds are backed by the U.S. government, while municipal bonds can offer tax advantages. Consider allocating a portion of your fixed deposits or stocks into these bonds to enhance stability and yield.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Dividend-Paying Stocks:**\n",
      "   - **Blue-Chip Stocks:** Invest in established companies with a history of stable earnings and consistent dividend payments. These stocks can provide a steady income stream while also offering potential for capital appreciation. Look for companies in sectors like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs):**\n",
      "   - **REITs:** These can provide a good source of income through dividends and can be less volatile than direct real estate investments. Look for REITs that focus on residential or commercial properties with stable cash flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Fixed Income Funds:**\n",
      "   - **Bond Funds or Target-Date Funds:** Consider investing in bond mutual funds or ETFs that focus on high-quality bonds. Target-date funds can also be a good option as they automatically adjust the asset allocation as you approach retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **High-Yield Savings Accounts or CDs:**\n",
      "   - **Certificates of Deposit (CDs):** If you prefer to keep your cash liquid but still want a better return than a regular savings account, consider CDs. They offer fixed interest rates for a specified term and are FDIC insured.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Annuities:**\n",
      "   - **Fixed Annuities:** These can provide guaranteed income for a certain period or for life, which can be beneficial in retirement. Ensure you understand the fees and terms before investing.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **Maintain a Cash Reserve:**\n",
      "   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a cash reserve for unexpected expenses. This can be kept in a high-yield savings account for easy access.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Portfolio Adjustment Suggestions:\n",
      "- **Rebalance Your Portfolio:** Given your current allocation, consider reducing your exposure to stocks (from $10,000) and increasing your bond allocation. A suggested allocation could be:\n",
      "  - Bonds: $80,000\n",
      "  - Fixed Deposits: $30,000\n",
      "  - Dividend-Paying Stocks: $10,000\n",
      "  - REITs: $5,000\n",
      "  - Cash Reserve: $5,000\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Thoughts:\n",
      "As you approach retirement, it's crucial to prioritize capital preservation and income generation. Regularly review your portfolio and adjust as necessary to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.\n",
